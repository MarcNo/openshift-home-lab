## You need to set the openshift_subscription_pool for your own Red Hat account.
## Using this command will tell you the pool id:
##     subscription-manager list --all --available --matches "*openshift*"
##
## This is tied to my Red Hat subscription, so it won't work for you.  
openshift_subscription_pool: 8a85f98b651a7ece016533cca34a225a
